# Material for the workshop CARTO for Spatial Data Science

This is a GitHub page containing some data sets and Jupyter notebooks used in the workshop **CARTO for Spatial Data Science** (https://carto.com/) at The Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis - UCL (London).

## Training on the CARTO platform for Spatial Data Science

In the `notebooks` directory, you can find the following Jupyter notebooks:

- `notebooks/Visualizing_spatial_data.ipynb` - A good place to start. It shows how to easily visualize data on a map using CARTOframes.

- `notebooks/Spatial_dependence.ipynb` - A Jupyter notebook for exploring spatial dependence in your data and for visualizing the results using CARTOframes.

- `notebooks/Discrete_spatial_models.ipynb` - A Jupyter notebook to run some examples of spatial models for discrete processes and for visualizing the results using CARTOframes.

- `notebooks/Continous_spatial_models.ipynb` - A Jupyter notebook to run some examples of spatial models for continuous processes and for visualizing the results using CARTOframes.

- `notebooks/Optimization_TSP.ipynb` - A Jupyter notebook to solve the Travelling salesman optimization problem and for visualizing the results using CARTOframes.

The `notebooks/data` directory contains data, which are needed to run the examples.

The `notebooks/src_import` directory contains some helper functions.

### What you need to run the notebooks

- **Python**. Follow instructions here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ If you want to set up a virtual environment here is how you can do it: https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/.

- **R**. Follow instructions here: https://cran.r-project.org/?source=post_page-----917519326e41----------------------

- **Jupyter notebooks**. Follow instructions here: https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html?source=post_page-----917519326e41----------------------

- **R kernel for Jupyter**. Follow the instructions here: https://medium.com/@kyleake/how-to-install-r-in-jupyter-with-irkernel-in-3-steps-917519326e41 or if you have a MAC here: https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-install-r-kernel-for-jupyter-on-mac-os-x/.

- All python packages in the `notebooks/requirements.txt` file. Open your terminal and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Location Data Streams & Spatial Models

Finally, the `demos/` directory contains the html versions of the jupyter notebooks discussed during the session.

Good luck!
